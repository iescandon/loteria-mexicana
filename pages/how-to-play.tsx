            <li>
              Assign one person to be the dealer. Everyone else will be a
              player.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are a player, click on the tabla on this page to get one.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are a dealer, click on the start button after all of the
              players have gotten their tablas. The dealer will call out the
              cards one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a player has that card, they will click on the card in their
              tabla to place a frijol on it. If you accidentally put a frijol on
              a card by accident, click on it again to remove the frijol.
            </li>
            <li>
              The dealer will continue to call out cards until there is a
              winner!
            </li>
            <li>
              A player can win by having 4 in a row (diagonically, vertically,
              or horizontally) or by having the 4 corners. If a player has won,
              they must yell out Â¡Buenas! before the next card has been called.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the dealer verifies that the player has officially won, they
              will end the game. The game can be played as many times as you
              like! The dealer can continue to be the dealer or they can choose
              someone else to be the dealer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players can continue to use the same tabla for future games, all
              they need to do is click on all their beans to clear their table.
              If a player would like a different tabla, click refresh to get a
              brand new tabla with new cards.
            </li>

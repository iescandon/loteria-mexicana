# Loteria Mexicana

A mobile-responsive digital version of the traditional Mexican game Lotería, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Developed for a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration hosted by my company's Latino ERG, which I help lead. The app replicates gameplay with a randomized card deck, interactive boards, and randomized beans. Created to celebrate cultural heritage while demonstrating modern front-end development and user interaction patterns.

## How to Play
- Designate one player as the caller to draw and announce cards from the deck. The rest will be the players.
- Once all players have their Lotería cards ready, the caller will click "Start."
- The caller will announce one card at a time. If a player has that card, they click on the corresponding square on their Lotería card to mark it with a bean.
- The game continues until a player gets 4 in a row (diagonal, vertical, or horizontal) and wins!
- Players can play again by clicking "Refresh" to clear the beans and receive a new card.
